# insitu_probe_generator
Generate HCR-style Probe Pairs for fluorescent in situ mRNA visualization

In this directory you will find a few options to generate your own HCR probes.

We are providing the code written in Python 2.7 and Python 3. Choose the program that matches your version of Python. 

Also provided is the code in Jupyter python notebook format (ipynb) (again written in Python 2.7 or 3).  
  This is probably the easiest way to run the program.
  
We have intentionally kept the program simple to avoid having many dependencies, however you will need to run Python and/or Jupyter. If you need help with this, see "DEPENDENCIES.md" file in the main directory.
