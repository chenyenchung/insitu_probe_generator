# HELP! Where do I start?! I want to make my own HCR probes but am not a programmer.

We feel you, we're not particularly gifted with programming either. Here's what you need to do to make the most of this program:

1. You will have to have Python on your machine. 
  + Python comes in a few versions: 
    1. Python 2 is an older release but because it was around for a long time many libraries have been written for it. Eventually however, it is going to be phased out and no longer supported.
    2. Python 3 is the newer version that will continue to be developed and supported.
  + If you just want to get started, we'd say go with Python 3.
  + [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) is a basic, helpful Python installer that will let you install your flavor of Python as well as make installing add-on programs easier.

2. We wrote our HCR probe maker with an interactive interface, [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/index.html), in mind.
  + See step 1 if you don't have Python installed on your machine.
  + To get Jupyter follow this [guide.](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
  + Once installed, you can run the ".ipynb" programs and can ignore the commandline ".py" versions.
